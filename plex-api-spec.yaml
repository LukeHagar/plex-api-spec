    description: |
      Activities provide a way to monitor and control asynchronous operations on the server. In order to receive real-time updates for activities, a client would normally subscribe via either EventSource or Websocket endpoints.

      Activities are associated with HTTP replies via a special `X-Plex-Activity` header which contains the UUID of the activity.

      Activities are optional cancellable. If cancellable, they may be cancelled via the `DELETE` endpoint.

    description: |
      Media grabbers provide ways for media to be obtained for a given protocol. The simplest ones are `stream` and `download`. More complex grabbers can have associated devices

      Network tuners can present themselves on the network using the Simple Service Discovery Protocol and Plex Media Server will discover them. The following XML is an example of the data returned from SSDP. The `deviceType`, `serviceType`, and `serviceId` values must remain as they are in the example in order for PMS to properly discover the device. Other less-obvious fields are described in the parameters section below.

  - name: Play Queue
    description: "The playqueue feature within a media provider\nA play queue represents the current list of media for playback. Although queues are persisted by the server, they should be regarded by the user as a fairly lightweight, an ephemeral list of items queued up for playback in a session.  There is generally one active queue for each type of media (music, video, photos) that can be added to or destroyed and replaced with a fresh queue.\nPlay Queues has a region, which we refer to in this doc (partially for historical reasons) as \"Up Next\". This region is defined by `playQueueLastAddedItemID` existing on the media container. This follows iTunes' terminology. It is a special region after the currently playing item but before the originally-played items. This enables \"Party Mode\" listening/viewing, where items can be added on-the-fly, and normal queue playback resumed when completed. \nYou can visualize the play queue as a sliding window in the complete list of media queued for playback. This model is important when scaling to larger play queues (e.g. shuffling 40,000 audio tracks). The client only needs visibility into small areas of the queue at any given time, and the server can optimize access in this fashion.\nAll created play queues will have an empty \"Up Next\" area - unless the item is an album and no `key` is provided. In this case the \"Up Next\" area will be populated by the contents of the album. This is to allow queueing of multiple albums - since the 'Add to Up Next' will insert after all the tracks. This means that If you're creating a PQ from an album, you can only shuffle it if you set `key`. This is due to the above implicit queueing of albums when no `key` is provided as well as the current limitation that you cannot shuffle a PQ with an \"Up Next\" area.\nThe play queue window advances as the server receives timeline requests. The client needs to retrieve the play queue as the “now playing” item changes. There is no play queue API to update the playing item."

      summary: Start all Butler tasks

      description: |
        This endpoint will attempt to start all Butler tasks that are enabled in the settings. Butler tasks normally run automatically during a time window configured on the server's Settings page but can be manually started using this endpoint. Tasks will run with the following criteria:

          1. Any tasks not scheduled to run on the current day will be skipped.
          2. If a task is configured to run at a random time during the configured window and we are outside that window, the task will start immediately.
          3. If a task is configured to run at a random time during the configured window and we are within that window, the task will be scheduled at a random time within the window.
          4. If we are outside the configured window, the task will start immediately.

        Perform a search and get the result as hubs

        This endpoint performs a search across all library sections, or a single section, and returns matches as hubs, split up by type. It performs spell checking, looks for partial matches, and orders the hubs based on quality of results. In addition, based on matches, it will return other related matches (e.g. for a genre match, it may return movies in that genre, or for an actor match, movies with that actor).

        In the response's items, the following extra attributes are returned to further describe or disambiguate the result:

        - `reason`: The reason for the result, if not because of a direct search term match; can be either:
          - `section`: There are multiple identical results from different sections.
          - `originalTitle`: There was a search term match from the original title field (sometimes those can be very different or in a foreign language).
          - `<hub identifier>`: If the reason for the result is due to a result in another hub, the source hub identifier is returned. For example, if the search is for "dylan" then Bob Dylan may be returned as an artist result, an a few of his albums returned as album results with a reason code of `artist` (the identifier of that particular hub). Or if the search is for "arnold", there might be movie results returned with a reason of `actor`
        - `reasonTitle`: The string associated with the reason code. For a section reason, it'll be the section name; For a hub identifier, it'll be a string associated with the match (e.g. `Arnold Schwarzenegger` for movies which were returned because the search was for "arnold").
        - `reasonID`: The ID of the item associated with the reason for the result. This might be a section ID, a tag ID, an artist ID, or a show ID.

        This request is intended to be very fast, and called as the user types.

        Perform a search tailored to voice input and get the result as hubs

        This endpoint performs a search specifically tailored towards voice or other imprecise input which may work badly with the substring and spell-checking heuristics used by the `/hubs/search` endpoint. It uses a [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) heuristic to search titles, and as such is much slower than the other search endpoint. Whenever possible, clients should limit the search to the appropriate type.

        Results, as well as their containing per-type hubs, contain a `distance` attribute which can be used to judge result quality.

      description: |-
        This endpoint takes a file path specified in the `url` parameter, matches it using the scanner's match mechanism, downloads rich metadata, and then ingests the item as a transient item (without a library section). In the case where the file represents an episode, the entire tree (show, season, and episode) is added as transient items. At this time, movies and episodes are the only supported types, which are gleaned automatically from the file path.
        Note that any of the parameters passed to the metadata details endpoint (e.g. `includeExtras=1`) work here.

      summary: Get library matches
      operationId: getLibraryMatches
      description: |-
        The matches endpoint is used to match content external to the library with content inside the library. This is done by passing a series of semantic "hints" about the content (its type, name, or release year). Each type (e.g. movie) has a canonical set of minimal required hints.
        This ability to match content is useful in a variety of scenarios. For example, in the DVR, the EPG uses the endpoint to match recording rules against airing content. And in the cloud, the UMP uses the endpoint to match up a piece of media with rich metadata.
        The endpoint response can including multiple matches, if there is ambiguity, each one containing a `score` from 0 to 100. For somewhat historical reasons, anything over 85 is considered a positive match (we prefer false negatives over false positives in general for matching).
        The `guid` hint is somewhat special, in that it generally represents a unique identity for a piece of media (e.g. the IMDB `ttXXX`) identifier, in contrast with other hints which can be much more ambiguous (e.g. a title of `Jane Eyre`, which could refer to the 1943 or the 2011 version).
        Episodes require either a season/episode pair, or an air date (or both). Either the path must be sent, or the show title

        A library section (commonly referred to as just a library) is a collection of media. Libraries are typed, and depending on their type provide either a flat or a hierarchical view of the media. For example, a music library has an artist > albums > tracks structure, whereas a movie library is flat.
        Libraries have features beyond just being a collection of media; for starters, they include information about supported types, filters and sorts. This allows a client to provide a rich interface around the media (e.g. allow sorting movies by release year).

        Makes a new play queue for a device. The source of the playqueue can either be a URI, or a playlist. The response is a media container with the initial items in the queue. Each item in the queue will be a regular item but with `playQueueItemID` - a unique ID since the queue could have repeated items with the same `ratingKey`.

                            - Primary: (e.g. all, On Deck) These are still used in some clients to provide "shortcuts" to subsets of media. However, with the exception of On Deck, all of them can be created by media queries, and the desire is to allow these to be customized by users.
                            - Secondary: These are marked with `"secondary": true` and were used by old clients to provide nested menus allowing for primative (but structured) navigation.
                            - Special: There is a By Folder entry which allows browsing the media by the underlying filesystem structure, and there's a completely obsolete entry marked `"search": true` which used to be used to allow clients to build search dialogs on the fly.

                      summary: Already accepted as a bona fide talent in the world of parody -- his musicianship, comedic timing, his pop-culture reference awareness, and his great wordplay are all well-documented -- the only thing that matters when it comes to "Weird Al" Yankovic albums is how inspired the king of novelty songs sounds on any given LP. On his 14th studio album, Mandatory Fun, the inspiration meter goes well into the red, something heard instantly as Iggy Azalea's electro-rap "Fancy" does a complete 180 thematically on the opening "Handy," the song now heading toward the local home improvement store where the craftsmen vogue in their orange vests and blow sweet come-ons like "I'll bring you up to code" and "My socket wrenches are second to none." Pharrell's "Happy" becomes "Tacky" and Al's amazing ability to follow an everyday poke ("Wear my Ed Hardy shirt with fluorescent orange pants") with something brainy and reserved ("Got my new résumé, it's printed in Comic Sans") surprises once more, but for end-to-end "wows," it's his brilliant redo of Robin Thicke's "Blurred Lines," now the smug and twerking "Word Crimes," which gives copy editors, English professors, and grammar nerds a reason to hit the dancefloor ("And listen up when I tell you this/I hope you never use quotation marks for emphasis!"). Hardcore and hilarious musical moments start to happen when Imagine Dragons' "Radioactive" becomes "Inactive," a singalong anthem for the sluggish and the slovenly ("Near comatose, no exercise/Don't tag my toe, I'm still alive") with a dubstep-rock bassline that sounds like Galactus burping. Better still is the every-Al-album pop-polka medley, this time called "Now That's What I Call Polka!" which polkas-up Daft Punk ("Get Lucky"), PSY ("Gangnam Style"), and Miley Cyrus ("Wrecking Ball"), and with more Spike Jones-styled sound effects than usual. As for the originals this time out, the "you suck!"-minded "Sports Song" will be unavoidable under Friday night lights once a teen gets hold of it, while the ranting and wonderfully weird "First World Problems" sounds more like the Pixies than anything the Pixies did in 2014. Wonders never cease on Mandatory Fun, and neither do the laughs. ~ David Jeffries

            - Technically square brackets are not allowed in an URI except the Internet Protocol Literal Address
            - RFC3513: A host identified by an Internet Protocol literal address, version 6 [RFC3513] or later, is distinguished by enclosing the IP literal within square brackets ("[" and "]"). This is the only place where square bracket characters are allowed in the URI syntax.
            - Escaped square brackets are allowed, but don't render well

        Get a media part for streaming or download.
          - streaming: This is the default scenario.  Bandwidth usage on this endpoint will be guaranteed (on the server's end) to be at least the bandwidth reservation given in the decision.  If no decision exists, an ad-hoc decision will be created if sufficient bandwidth exists.  Clients should not rely on ad-hoc decisions being made as this may be removed in the future.
          - download: Indicated if the query parameter indicates this is a download.  Bandwidth will be prioritized behind playbacks and will get a fair share of what remains.

                        - Secondary: These are marked with `"secondary": true` and were used by old clients to provide nested menus allowing for primative (but structured) navigation.
                        - Special: There is a By Folder entry which allows browsing the media by the underlying filesystem structure, and there's a completely obsolete entry marked `"search": true` which used to be used to allow clients to build search dialogs on the fly.

    Media:

        `Media` represents an one or more media files (parts) and is a child of a metadata item. There aren't necessarily any guaranteed attributes on media elements since the attributes will vary based on the type. The possible attributes are not documented here, but they typically have self-evident names. High-level media information that can be used for badging and flagging, such as `videoResolution` and codecs, is included on the media element.

    MediaContainer:
      description: |
        `MediaContainer` is the root element of most Plex API responses. It serves as a generic container for various types of content (Metadata, Hubs, Directories, etc.) and includes pagination information (offset, size, totalSize) when applicable.
        Common attributes: - identifier: Unique identifier for this container - size: Number of items in this response page - totalSize: Total number of items available (for pagination) - offset: Starting index of this page (for pagination)
        The container often "hoists" common attributes from its children. For example, if all tracks in a container share the same album title, the `parentTitle` attribute may appear on the MediaContainer rather than being repeated on each track.

    MediaContainerWithDecision:
      description: |
        `MediaContainer` is commonly found as the root of a response and is a pretty generic container. Common attributes include `identifier` and things related to paging (`offset`, `size`, `totalSize`).

        It is also common for a `MediaContainer` to contain attributes "hoisted" from its children. If every element in the container would have had the same attribute, then that attribute can be present on the container instead of being repeated on every element. For example, an album's list of tracks might include `parentTitle` on the container since all of the tracks have the same album title. A container may have a `source` attribute when all of the items came from the same source. Generally speaking, when looking for an attribute on an item, if the attribute wasn't found then the container should be checked for that attribute as well.

    Metadata:
      description: |
        Items in a library are referred to as "metadata items." These metadata items are distinct from "media items" which represent actual instances of media that can be consumed. Consider a TV library that has a single video file in it for a particular episode of a show. The library has a single media item, but it has three metadata items: one for the show, one for the season, and one for the episode. Consider a movie library that has two video files in it: the same movie, but two different resolutions. The library has a single metadata item for the movie, but that metadata item has two media items, one for each resolution. Additionally a "media item" will have one or more "media parts" where the the parts are intended to be watched together, such as a CD1 and CD2 parts of the same movie.

        Note that when a metadata item has multiple media items, those media items should be isomorphic. That is, a 4K version and 1080p version of a movie are different versions of the same movie. They have the same duration, same summary, same rating, etc. and they can generally be considered interchangeable. A theatrical release vs. director's cut vs. unrated version on the other hand would be separate metadata items.

        Metadata items can often live in a hierarchy with relationships between them.  For example, the metadata item for an episodes is associated with a season metadata item which is associated with a show metadata item.  A similar hierarchy exists with track, album, and artist and photos and photo album.  The relationships may be expressed via relative terms and absolute terms.  For example, "leaves" refer to metadata items which has associated media (there is no media for a season nor show).  A show will have "children" in the form of seasons and a season will have "children" in the form of episodes and episodes have "parent" in the form of a season which has a "parent" in the form of a show.  Similarly, a show has "grandchildren" in the form of episodse and an episode has a "grandparent" in the form of a show.

    Part:
      description: |
        `Part` represents a particular file or "part" of a media item. The part is the playable unit of the media hierarchy. Suppose that a movie library contains a movie that is broken up into files, reminiscent of a movie split across two BDs. The metadata item represents information about the movie, the media item represents this instance of the movie at this resolution and quality, and the part items represent the two playable files.  If another media were added which contained the joining of these two parts transcoded down to a lower resolution, then this metadata would contain 2 medias, one with 2 parts and one with 1 part.

        `Stream` represents a particular stream from a media item, such as the video stream, audio stream, or subtitle stream. The stream may either be part of the file represented by the parent `Part` or, especially for subtitles, an external file. The stream contains more detailed information about the specific stream. For example, a video may include the `aspectRatio` at the `Media` level, but detailed information about the video stream like the color space will be included on the `Stream` for the video stream.  Note that photos do not have streams (mostly as an optimization).
