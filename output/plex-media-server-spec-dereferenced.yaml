    description: |
      Activities are awesome. They provide a way to monitor and control asynchronous operations on the server. In order to receive real-time updates for activities, a client would normally subscribe via either EventSource or Websocket endpoints.
      Activities are associated with HTTP replies via a special `X-Plex-Activity` header which contains the UUID of the activity.
      Activities are optional cancellable. If cancellable, they may be cancelled via the `DELETE` endpoint. Other details:
      - They can contain a `progress` (from 0 to 100) marking the percent completion of the activity.
      - They must contain an `type` which is used by clients to distinguish the specific activity.
      - They may contain a `Context` object with attributes which associate the activity with various specific entities (items, libraries, etc.)
      - The may contain a `Response` object which attributes which represent the result of the asynchronous operation.

    description: |
      Hubs are a structured two-dimensional container for media, generally represented by multiple horizontal rows.
  - name: Playlists
    description: |
      Playlists are ordered collections of media. They can be dumb (just a list of media) or smart (based on a media query, such as "all albums from 2017").
      They can be organized in (optionally nesting) folders.
      Retrieving a playlist, or its items, will trigger a refresh of its metadata.
      This may cause the duration and number of items to change.

      summary: Perform a search

      description: |
        This endpoint performs a search across all library sections, or a single section, and returns matches as hubs, split up by type. It performs spell checking, looks for partial matches, and orders the hubs based on quality of results. In addition, based on matches, it will return other related matches (e.g. for a genre match, it may return movies in that genre, or for an actor match, movies with that actor).

        In the response's items, the following extra attributes are returned to further describe or disambiguate the result:

        - `reason`: The reason for the result, if not because of a direct search term match; can be either:
          - `section`: There are multiple identical results from different sections.
          - `originalTitle`: There was a search term match from the original title field (sometimes those can be very different or in a foreign language).
          - `<hub identifier>`: If the reason for the result is due to a result in another hub, the source hub identifier is returned. For example, if the search is for "dylan" then Bob Dylan may be returned as an artist result, an a few of his albums returned as album results with a reason code of `artist` (the identifier of that particular hub). Or if the search is for "arnold", there might be movie results returned with a reason of `actor`
        - `reasonTitle`: The string associated with the reason code. For a section reason, it'll be the section name; For a hub identifier, it'll be a string associated with the match (e.g. `Arnold Schwarzenegger` for movies which were returned because the search was for "arnold").
        - `reasonID`: The ID of the item associated with the reason for the result. This might be a section ID, a tag ID, an artist ID, or a show ID.

        This request is intended to be very fast, and called as the user types.

      description: |
        This endpoint performs a search specifically tailored towards voice or other imprecise input which may work badly with the substring and spell-checking heuristics used by the `/hubs/search` endpoint. 
        It uses a [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) heuristic to search titles, and as such is much slower than the other search endpoint. 
        Whenever possible, clients should limit the search to the appropriate type. 
        Results, as well as their containing per-type hubs, contain a `distance` attribute which can be used to judge result quality.

        A library section (commonly referred to as just a library) is a collection of media. 
        Libraries are typed, and depending on their type provide either a flat or a hierarchical view of the media. 
        For example, a music library has an artist > albums > tracks structure, whereas a movie library is flat.

        Libraries have features beyond just being a collection of media; for starters, they include information about supported types, filters and sorts. 
        This allows a client to provide a rich interface around the media (e.g. allow sorting movies by release year).

        ## Library Details Endpoint

        This endpoint provides comprehensive details about the library, focusing on organizational aspects rather than the content itself.

        The details include:

        ### Directories
        Organized into three categories:

        - **Primary Directories**:
          - Used in some clients for quick access to media subsets (e.g., "All", "On Deck").
          - Most can be replicated via media queries.
          - Customizable by users.

        - **Secondary Directories**:
          - Marked with `secondary="1"`.
          - Used in older clients for structured navigation.

        - **Special Directories**:
          - Includes a "By Folder" entry for filesystem-based browsing.
          - Contains an obsolete `search="1"` entry for on-the-fly search dialog creation.

        ### Types
        Each type in the library comes with a set of filters and sorts, aiding in building dynamic media controls:

        - **Type Object Attributes**:
          - `key`: Endpoint for the media list of this type.
          - `type`: Metadata type (if standard Plex type).
          - `title`: Title for this content type (e.g., "Movies").

        - **Filter Objects**:
          - Subset of the media query language.
          - Attributes include `filter` (name), `filterType` (data type), `key` (endpoint for value range), and `title`.

        - **Sort Objects**:
          - Description of sort fields.
          - Attributes include `defaultDirection` (asc/desc), `descKey` and `key` (sort parameters), and `title`.

        > **Note**: Filters and sorts are optional; without them, no filtering controls are rendered.

        ### Types
        Each type in the library comes with a set of filters and sorts, aiding in building dynamic media controls:

        - **Type Object Attributes**:
          - `type`: Metadata type (if standard Plex type).  
          - `title`: Title for this content type (e.g., "Movies").

        - **Filter Objects**:
          - Subset of the media query language.
          - Attributes include `filter` (name), `filterType` (data type), `key` (endpoint for value range), and `title`.

        - **Sort Objects**:
          - Description of sort fields.
          - Attributes include `defaultDirection` (asc/desc), `descKey` and `key` (sort parameters), and `title`.

        > **Note**: Filters and sorts are optional; without them, no filtering controls are rendered.

      summary: Logging a multi-line message
      description: |
        This endpoint allows for the batch addition of log entries to the main Plex Media Server log.
        It accepts a text/plain request body, where each line represents a distinct log entry.
        Each log entry consists of URL-encoded key-value pairs, specifying log attributes such as 'level', 'message', and 'source'.

        Log entries are separated by a newline character (`\n`).
        Each entry's parameters should be URL-encoded to ensure accurate parsing and handling of special characters.
        This method is efficient for logging multiple entries in a single API call, reducing the overhead of multiple individual requests.

        The 'level' parameter specifies the log entry's severity or importance, with the following integer values:
        - `0`: Error - Critical issues that require immediate attention.
        - `1`: Warning - Important events that are not critical but may indicate potential issues.
        - `2`: Info - General informational messages about system operation.
        - `3`: Debug - Detailed information useful for debugging purposes.
        - `4`: Verbose - Highly detailed diagnostic information for in-depth analysis.

        The 'message' parameter contains the log text, and 'source' identifies the log message's origin (e.g., an application name or module).

        Example of a single log entry format:
        `level=4&message=Sample%20log%20entry&source=applicationName`

        Ensure each parameter is properly URL-encoded to avoid interpretation issues.

      summary: Retrieve Playlist Contents
      description: |
        Gets the contents of a playlist. Should be paged by clients via standard mechanisms. 
        By default leaves are returned (e.g. episodes, movies). In order to return other types you can use the `type` parameter. 
        For example, you could use this to display a list of recently added albums vis a smart playlist. 
        Note that for dumb playlists, items have a `playlistItemID` attribute which is used for deleting or moving items.
