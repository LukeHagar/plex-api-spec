  - name: Activities
    description: |
      Activities are awesome. They provide a way to monitor and control asynchronous operations on the server. In order to receive real-time updates for activities, a client would normally subscribe via either EventSource or Websocket endpoints.
      Activities are associated with HTTP replies via a special `X-Plex-Activity` header which contains the UUID of the activity.
      Activities are optional cancellable. If cancellable, they may be cancelled via the `DELETE` endpoint. Other details:
      - They can contain a `progress` (from 0 to 100) marking the percent completion of the activity.
      - They must contain an `type` which is used by clients to distinguish the specific activity.
      - They may contain a `Context` object with attributes which associate the activity with various specific entities (items, libraries, etc.)
      - The may contain a `Response` object which attributes which represent the result of the asynchronous operation.

      Hubs are a structured two-dimensional container for media, generally represented by multiple horizontal rows.
  - name: Playlists
    description: |
      Playlists are ordered collections of media. They can be dumb (just a list of media) or smart (based on a media query, such as "all albums from 2017").
      They can be organized in (optionally nesting) folders.
      Retrieving a playlist, or its items, will trigger a refresh of its metadata.
      This may cause the duration and number of items to change.
