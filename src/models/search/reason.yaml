      The reason for the inclusion in the search result, if not because of a direct search term match; can be either:
      - `section`: There are multiple identical results from different sections.
      - `originalTitle`: There was a search term match from the original title field (sometimes those can be very different or in a foreign language).
      - `<hub identifier>`: If the reason for the result is due to a result in another hub, the source hub identifier is returned. For example, if the search is for "dylan" then Bob Dylan may be returned as an artist result, an a few of his albums returned as album results with a reason code of `artist` (the identifier of that particular hub). Or if the search is for "arnold", there might be movie results returned with a reason of `actor`
