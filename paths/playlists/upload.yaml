  summary: Upload Playlist
  description: |
    Imports m3u playlists by passing a path on the server to scan for m3u-formatted playlist files, or a path to a single playlist file.
  operationId: uploadPlaylist
  parameters:
    - name: path
      description: |
        absolute path to a directory on the server where m3u files are stored, or the absolute path to a playlist file on the server. 
        If the `path` argument is a directory, that path will be scanned for playlist files to be processed. 
        Each file in that directory creates a separate playlist, with a name based on the filename of the file that created it. 
        The GUID of each playlist is based on the filename. 
        If the `path` argument is a file, that file will be used to create a new playlist, with the name based on the filename of the file that created it. 
        The GUID of each playlist is based on the filename.

        Force overwriting of duplicate playlists.  
        By default, a playlist file uploaded with the same path will overwrite the existing playlist. 
        The `force` argument is used to disable overwriting.  
        If the `force` argument is set to 0, a new playlist will be created suffixed with the date and time that the duplicate was uploaded.
